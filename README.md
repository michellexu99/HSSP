# Introduction to the HSSP
The HSSP method is a new method to identify the power grid topology, which can realize the recognition of multi-level power grid topology. Compared with other methods, its advantages are fast recognition speed and high accuracy.

# The data set
In the “Dataset” folder are five exl files, which are digitizations of the grid topology with 13,33,63,93,123 nodes, to verify the performance of the algorithm with different numbers of nodes.
